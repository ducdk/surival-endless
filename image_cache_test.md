# Image Cache Implementation Test

## Problem
The game was making excessive HTTP requests for images, causing performance issues and lag. This happened because:
1. Each entity instance created its own Image() object
2. No global caching mechanism existed for images
3. The same images were loaded multiple times (e.g., each monster instance loaded its own image)

## Solution Implemented
Created a global ImageCache system with the following features:
1. Singleton pattern to ensure only one cache exists
2. Each image file is loaded only once
3. Reuses cached images across all entity instances
4. Handles both successful loading and error cases
5. Provides a simple interface for entities to get images

## Files Modified
1. `src/entities/ImageCache.js` - Created global image cache
2. `src/entities/Resource.js` - Updated to use global cache
3. `src/entities/Monster.js` - Updated to use global cache
4. `src/entities/Bullet.js` - Updated to use global cache
5. `src/entities/Character.js` - Updated to use global cache

## How It Works
1. Each entity now imports ImageCache
2. Instead of `new Image()` and setting `src`, entities now use `ImageCache.getImage(src)`
3. ImageCache checks if image is already cached before loading
4. If not cached, ImageCache loads the image and stores it
5. All subsequent requests for the same image return the cached version

## Benefits Achieved
1. Each image file is loaded only once
2. Reduced HTTP requests and bandwidth usage
3. Improved rendering performance
4. Better memory usage through reuse
5. Maintains existing rendering fallbacks

## Performance Improvement
- Before: Each monster instance loaded its own image, resulting in hundreds of HTTP requests
- After: Each image loaded only once, regardless of how many instances exist
- This dramatically reduces network traffic and improves game performance

## Testing
To verify the solution works:
1. Open the game in a browser
2. Open Developer Tools (F12)
3. Go to the Network tab
4. Start the game and spawn many monsters
5. Observe that each image is only loaded once, not for each monster instance
