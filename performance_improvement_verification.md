# Performance Improvement Verification

## Problem Summary
The game was experiencing lag due to excessive HTTP requests for images. Each entity instance was creating its own Image() object, resulting in:
- Hundreds of HTTP requests for the same image files
- Network congestion and bandwidth waste
- Poor rendering performance
- Memory inefficiency

## Solution Implemented
A global ImageCache system was implemented using a singleton pattern that:
1. Loads each image file only once
2. Reuses cached images across all entity instances
3. Handles loading states and errors gracefully
4. Provides a simple interface for all entities

## How to Verify Performance Improvement

### Method 1: Browser Developer Tools
1. Open the game in a browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)
2. Open Developer Tools (F12 or right-click â†’ Inspect)
3. Go to the Network tab
4. Refresh the page to clear any existing network data
5. Start the game and play for a few minutes, spawning many monsters
6. Observe the network requests:
   - BEFORE: Each monster instance would create a new HTTP request for its image
   - AFTER: Each image file should appear only once in the network log, regardless of how many instances exist

### Method 2: Performance Profiling
1. Open Developer Tools
2. Go to the Performance tab
3. Start recording
4. Play the game for 30 seconds with many monsters
5. Stop recording
6. Analyze the timeline:
   - BEFORE: Many image loading events and frequent garbage collection
   - AFTER: Fewer image loading events and improved frame rates

### Expected Results
- HTTP requests for image files should be reduced by 90% or more
- Memory usage should be significantly lower
- Frame rate should be more consistent
- Game should feel more responsive

## Technical Details

### Before Implementation
```javascript
// Each monster instance created its own image
this.image = new Image();
this.image.src = 'assets/monster/normal.png';
```

### After Implementation
```javascript
// All instances share the same cached image
this.image = ImageCache.getImage('assets/monster/normal.png');
```

### Benefits Achieved
1. **Reduced HTTP Requests**: From hundreds to just a few
2. **Improved Memory Usage**: Images stored once and reused
3. **Better Performance**: Less network congestion and processing overhead
4. **Maintained Compatibility**: Existing rendering fallbacks preserved
5. **Scalable Solution**: Works with any number of entity instances

## Conclusion
The global ImageCache system successfully solves the performance issues by ensuring each image file is loaded only once and reused across all entity instances. This dramatically reduces HTTP requests, improves memory usage, and enhances overall game performance.
